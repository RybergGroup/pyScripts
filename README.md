Some potentially useful Python scripts

## getSocken.py
The getSocken.py script was written by ChatGPT with minor changes.
It depend on geopandas (pip install geopandas) and the database sockenstad.gpkg (provided by Lantm√§terriet under CC0).
Thi input file should be given as only argument to the script, e.g. ```python3 getSocken.py my_coordinates.csv```.
The CSV file should be comma separated with at least a longitude and latitude heading (see points.csv for an example).
